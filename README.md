# Quaternion Dynamical System Learning

### Double cover of quaternion
- It turns out that though -q and q represent the same rotation, they yield greatly different results when dealing with riemannian logarithm.
For example, when projecting a decaying sequence of angular velocity (in quaternion) wrt identity, one should expect the projected angular velocity
converge to zero; i.e. the zero rotation is equivalent to the identity quaternion. However, if the point of tangency is negative identity, which is
still identity and representing zero rotation, the projected angular velocity is now DIVERGING! 
- Solution could be: 
    1. force cannonical representation of quaternions; need to ensure smoothness of trajectory in both orientation and angular velocity on real data
    2. double-cover invariant in riemannian logarithm

thoughts
- angular velocity directly acted on current orientation(world frame vs. local frame)
- is cannocal quaternion always the right option? maybe should choose the one closest to the att out of two
